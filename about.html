    <h4>
        "SwedishBoy.org" is a website created very poorly by a swedish kid who wont say his name.
        The reason there is mostly scratch games on the "games" page is because it is really hard to find
        games/websites that allows Iframe. Iframe is basically a thing in code that allows you
        to port things from other websites to your website. But scratch allows you to use Iframe.
        I know that the website dosen't look the best but im trying to improve my html skills and
        this is my first project ever in code.

    <h1>
        THE REASON I MADE THIS
    </h1>
    <h4>
        this website is made mostly for when you're bored in school or just bored in general. I got
        the idea from websites like "poki", "crazygames" and "coolmathgames". They will all be linked
        at the bottom of this page  (pls dont sue me poki, crazygames or coolmathgames). This was also
        made because my terrible school blocks all theese websites.

    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <h4>
        hello. Im a swedish guy who wants to code but only knows a small bit of html that i learned from
        a youtube tutorial. I have made some games on Scratch myself but take a guess how they look. My
        account to scratch will be down below if you want to check them out. I have a youtube chanel where
        i make animations that are supposed to look bad so its funny. By the time im writing this i only
        have 2 videos tho. I also have an ipad that i draw on. I have drawn some stuff there and you can 
        find them down below too.
